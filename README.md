# CV_FishCardRoom-Current-Skills-

## App is not ready yet, but i decided to add it to my cv because shows my current skills in existing code.

# Shortcut: what you can find in my app.

### 1 - [Architecture  (MVVM)](https://github.com/Arakim411/CV_FishCardRoom-Current-Skills-/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/applications/fishcardroomandmvvm/viewModels)

### 2 - NavController (animations are not implemented yet)

### 3 - [RoomDatabase](https://github.com/Arakim411/CV_FishCardRoom-Current-Skills-/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/applications/fishcardroomandmvvm/ROOM)

### 4 - Corretc  Fragment management using (navController, supportFragmenManager, childFragmentManager)
**what i mean
Every Time when user rotate phone he won't lose state of fragment or activity. 
because fragments are created by correct way, that means:
every listener is added in OnAttach() method.
values are passed by arguments.
Changes made by user are saving with using viewModel.
[look on on]()**

### 5 - Communication between Activities, Fragments and child Fragments

### 6 - RecyclerView with [custom adapter](https://github.com/Arakim411/CV_FishCardRoom-Current-Skills-/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/applications/fishcardroomandmvvm/adapters)
  
### 7 - Spinners with [custom adapters](https://github.com/Arakim411/CV_FishCardRoom-Current-Skills-/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/applications/fishcardroomandmvvm/adapters)
